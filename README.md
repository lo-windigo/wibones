*Windigo's barebones framework*

This repository contains the "bones", or scaffolding/framework that I use to start any web project. It contains reusable styles, common files and tags, and anything else I find that I end up duplicating from a site-to-site basis.

While not tailored specifically to anyone's needs besides my own, please feel free to use it if it seems useful.
